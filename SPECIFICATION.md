# GitPub

## Overview

GitPub extends from the server-to-server layer of the [ActivityPub][activitypub] specification. Through this, repositories and branches can signal each other for updates.

GitPub only involves in server-to-server signaling. It does not involve in the underlying git operation or implemtation done by different server.

As compare to [GitPubSub][gitpubsub], this specification focus on signaling inter-repository operations (e.g. forking, pull request). [GitPubSub][gitpubsub], on the other hand, focus on signaling commits details in a repository.

In GitPub, each repository branch is represented by "branch" via a URL on a server. A repository is an alias to the default branch of it. The same set of commits on different server corresponds to different branches. 

Every Branch must have:

* **An `inbox`**: How it get notifications from the world.
* **An `outbox`**: How others pull information about it.

Server should notify the branch owner and / or its subscriber about the notification. But when and how a server should do it is outside the scope of this specification.

So:

* Someone's branch can `POST` its notification to your branch's `inbox` to notify your branch of its updates.
* You can `GET` from an someone's branch to see its latest updates.

### Pull Request

Pull Request, or "Merge Request" in some server, represents a request from a downstream branch for a `git pull` or `git merge` operation on an upstream branch.

In such case, when a user wants his / her branch to be pulled, he / she would send a pull request on the upstream branch web interface. Then:

* The upstream server SHOULD, in the background, get the information and commit of the downstream branch and generates an online URL of the request.
* The upstream SHOULD then `POST` to downstream's `inbox` and notify it of the successfully created **pull request**, along with information (TBD) for subscribing comments.
* The downstream SHOULD `POST` to upstream's `inbox` if it has any update (e.g. new commit).
* The downstream server MAY subscribe updates (e.g. comments, close, re-open) of the pull request on the upstream server.

### Fork

When a user wants to fork a remote upstream branch, he / she would fill in the source repository + branch, along with the target organization / account + repo name, to web interface of his / her server. Then,

* The downstream server SHOULD, in background, clone and fetch the inforamtion of the upstream branch to create local branch.
* The downstream server SHOULD then `POST` to upstream's `inbox` and notify it of the successfully created **fork**, along with information of subscribing it.
* The upstream server MAY subscribe updates of the downstream branch.
